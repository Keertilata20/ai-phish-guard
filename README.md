# 🛡️ AI Phish Guard

Detecting deception before it detects you.

AI Phish Guard is a phishing link detection web app that analyses suspicious URLs using behavioral signals, structural patterns, and multilingual phishing indicators — including Hindi-targeted scam attempts.

It provides users with a clear visual explanation of risk instead of just saying “safe” or “dangerous”.
